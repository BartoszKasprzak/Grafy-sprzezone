− loading any directed graph from a text file,
− checking whether the loaded graph is a conjugate graph,
− if the graph is a connected graph, checking whether it is a linear graph,
− writing a message about the result of the above check,
− if the graph is a connected graph, transforming it into its original graph (H),
− saving the resulting graph H to a text file other than the input file, but in the same format.
